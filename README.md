# lab-food-delivery
A fictional food delivery app, just like [iFood](https://www.ifood.com.br/) or [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/br). Built with microservices and microfrontends architectures in mind. Not a real product but a hobby one.

## Roadmap

First MVP should be simple and easy. It starts as a monolith.

Requirements:

1. Users should be able to login with Google account.
2. Users can see restaurants, products, and add items to cart. But they must login to proceed with checkout.
3. Users should be able to buy products through a credit card.
